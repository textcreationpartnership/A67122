1. The Preface.

#####Body#####

1. The Relation.

1. Mr WALKER's evidence.

    _ The firſt errour of Socinus and his followers is, That Juſtification is contained onely in Remiſsion of ſinnes, without imputation of Chriſt his Righteouſneſſe.

      * SOCINUS. His own words.

      * WOTTON.

    _ The ſecond point or errour is, That Faith is a condition appointed by God to be performed on our parts for obtaining of Juſtification.

      * SOCINUS.

      * WOTTON.

    _ The third errour is, That Faith doth not juſtifie us, as it apprehendeth Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, but by it ſelf, in a proper not metonymicall ſenſe.

      * SOCINUS.

      * WOTTON.

    _ The fourth errour is, That for faith properly taken, and dignified and made worthy, not of it ſelf, but in Gods acceptation and of his mercie, a man is juſtified, and may lay claim (as it were) to remiſsion of ſinnes.

      * SOCINUS.

      * WOTTON.

    _ The fifth errour is, That faith is no firm perſwaſion, by which men apprehend and lay hold upon Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, and apply them to themſelves, as of right belonging to us by our ſpirituall union: but that it is a truſt and confidence in Chriſt for ſalvation joyned with obedience to Chriſts precepts: or (to ſpeak plainly) a confidence that Chriſt, having obtained by his obedience the Kingdome and all power, will certainly give us ſalvation, if we relie on him, and obey his counſels.

      * SOCINUS.

      * WOTTON.

    _ The ſixth errour is, That Chriſts whole obedience and righteouſneſſe ſerve, firſt and immediately for himſelf, to bring him into favour and autoritie with God: and ſecondly onely for us: Not that it might be communicated to us in him, to make us truly and formally righteous, but onely that it might ſerve for our uſe in that it maketh him gracious with God, and ſo both able to obtain that faith might be accepted for righteouſneſſe,

and we for it; and alſo powerfull to give thoſe bleſsings which are promiſed to thoſe that truſt in him.

      * SOCINUS.

      * WOTTON.

    _ The ſeventh errour is, That Chriſt did not ſatisfie the juſtice of God for us, in ſuch ſort, that we may be ſaid (when we truly believe) to have ſatisfied the juſtice of God and his wrath in him: and that God of his mercie without Chriſts ſatisfaction made ours, doth pardon our ſinnes and juſtifie and redeem us.

      * SOCINUS.

      * WOTTON.
Thus have you the evidence by Mr Walker then given in for the juſtifying of that his charge: which,
